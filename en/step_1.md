- Take your motor controller board and, using a small screwdriver, loosen the screws in each of the three terminal blocks.

- The motors can be connected to their terminal blocks any way around. Then tighten the screws again.

- **Note**: The battery pack must be connected so that the red wire goes into port labelled **UTN**. The black wire goes into the port labelled **GND**. Make sure the battery pack is turned off when you do this.

- The kind of motor controller board used in this project can sit directly on the Raspberry Pi GPIO header pins, and uses **GPIO 7**, **8**, **9**, and **10**. With the motors and battery connected and the Pi switched off, you can place the board over the GPIO pins as shown below.

- You can now power up your Raspberry Pi.
